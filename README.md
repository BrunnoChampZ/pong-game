This project implements a basic version of the classic Pong game. It uses the Turtle module in Python for graphics and animation. The game features two paddles, one for each player, and a ball that bounces between them. The objective is to hit the ball with your paddle in a way that the opponent cannot return it.

## How to Play

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Run the `main.py` file using a Python interpreter.
3. Use the controls to move the paddles up and down.
4. The game continues until one player scores a certain number of points.
